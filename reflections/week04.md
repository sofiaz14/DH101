# Week 4 Reflection

Reflect 4: Is AI a collaborator, tool, or plagiarist in storytelling?
Based on my experience with AI, I see it more as a tool than a collaborator or a plagiarist in storytelling. It was useful for generating visuals for my comic, but it did not provide meaningful ideas or creative direction. Because of this, I see it as a tool. The concept and message of my story came entirely from my own thinking, while AI simply helped execute the images. This showed me that AI can support production, but the storytelling itself still relies on human creativity. But I also believe that, in other circumstances, AI can serve as both a tool and a collaborator. For example, in other assignments where I needed creative ideas, AI has helped me a lot; in those cases, it acted as a tool and collaborator.
