## Reflection

In my comic, I used humor and exaggeration to explore everyday power dynamics through the familiar relationship between a pet and its owner and through the real-world power dynamics between a landlord and a tenant. At first, I didn't know what I wanted to do for my comic, so I went to ChatGPT to help me figure out a theme and ideas for what I should make it about. After asking ChatGPT, I found that all their ideas were really bad and that they didn't have any good recommendations for what my comic should be about, so I made my own based on my thoughts and concluded that the cat is a landlord to the human. This shows that AI did not provide any good ideas and was not useful for this part of the assignment.

After I came up with my idea, I started working on my comic and decided to use an AI image generator for the pictures. I used Google Geminis Nano Bananato to create all the graphics, then used Canva to add the talking bubbles and text. Nano Banana was good for the image generation. The only time I had trouble was at the end, when I wanted the cat to be running around the woman while she was asleep. The first two images they made were extremely dark, and I couldn't see the cat or the human. I had to keep asking it to make the image brighter, but as you can see in my comic, that was the brightest it would get after I asked many times.

Overall, using AI in this project showed me that while it can be helpful for visual production, it is not very effective for creative thinking or developing meaningful ideas. The strongest part of my comic came from my own concept, while the AI functioned more as a tool to execute the visuals rather than a creative partner.

## Attribution & AI Use
- Tools used: Canva, Nano Banana
- AI prompts (summary): I asked the AI to create six different images of a human and her cat. I described what I was using the images for and what the comic was about, so the AI was more accurate in what I was looking for.
- What AI generated: Nano Banana generated six images for my comic.
